RockPaperScissors
=================

Friday challenge at Makers Academy

Play with the [RockPaperScissor](http://fathomless-lake-5547.herokuapp.com/) App

Here is the app at staging: http://rocky-coast-2876.herokuapp.com/

#### Task 1

Grab the code [from the repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/rockpaperscissors), and create a sinatra based web application that you can paly on your browser.

====


#### Task 2

Deploy the application to Heroku. Have two separate deployment targets: Staging and Production.

So you will have two apps on Heroku that you will be deploying to and three git remotes **(origin, staging production)**

The goal is to have two separate deployment targets running in the same environment and on the same platform. This way you can deploy to staging first and, if everything goes well, deploy to production later.

===========

#### Task 3

After deployed it to Heroku, add NewRelic add-on to the production environment on Heroku and find out the average page loading time using NewRelicÂ´s interface. Explore NewRelic to see what other analytical tools are available.

Write a little about what can be done with NewRelic in your own words and understanding.

==============

#### Bonus Level

Add some CSS to the app to make it beautiful.

What New Relic does
=================
New Relic provides a range of information about the performance of websites. It can measure the response time of the website, give a breakdown of response time per page, the memory usage, etc. and show the evolution of this performance over time.
